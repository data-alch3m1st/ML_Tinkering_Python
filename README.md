# 🧠 ML Tinkering: A Beginner's Journey into Machine Learning

Welcome to **ML Tinkering**, a personal collection of Jupyter notebooks documenting my early explorations into the world of **Machine Learning** using Python.

This repository is a hands-on, beginner-level sandbox where I experiment with foundational ML algorithms, data preprocessing techniques, and model evaluation strategies. As a data scientist starting out in machine learning, these notebooks reflect both what I've learned and how I've applied it.

## 🚀 Getting Started

To run these notebooks locally:

1. **Clone this repo:**

   ```bash
   git clone <https://github.com/data-alch3m1st/ML_Tinkering_Python.git>
   cd ML_Tinkering_Python

```

1. **Set up your Python environment:**
    
    It's recommended to use a virtual environment:
    
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\\Scripts\\activate
    
    ```
    
2. **Install dependencies:**
    
    This project primarily uses `numpy`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, and `jupyter`.
    
    ```bash
    # Not yet available; will uncomment when i've added!
    # pip install -r requirements.txt 
    
    ```
    
    Or install them manually:
    
    ```bash
    pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib jupyter
    
    ```
    
3. **Launch Jupyter Notebook:**
    
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    
    ```
